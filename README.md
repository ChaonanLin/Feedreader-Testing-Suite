# Project Overview

In this project, I used [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing web-based application that reads RSS feeds. These tested the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

# How to run
1. Git clone the repository to your computer from https://github.com/ChaonanLin/Feedreader-Testing-Suite.git
2. Open the The `index.html` file in browser to run the test. Test results display at the bottom of the page.

# What To Test


1. Test RSS Feeds are defined
2. Test RSS has a URL and the URL is defiened
3. Test RSS has a name and the names is defiened
4. Test the menu is hidden by default
5. Test the menu visible when clicked and hidden when clicked again
6. Test the Initial Entries is loaded
7. Test the New Feed Selection actually changes the content
